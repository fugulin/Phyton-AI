Explanation:

Libraries: We import requests for fetching data from public APIs and pipeline from the Transformers library to use a pre-trained language model.
Data Source: Define the URL of your chosen public dataset. Replace this with an API endpoint that provides relevant data for your chosen domain.
Load Data: This section outlines how to download and process the data. You'll need to replace this with your specific data processing logic (e.g., downloading, cleaning, tokenization).
Load Model: Define the name of the pre-trained language model you want to use. Choose a model suitable for question answering tasks (e.g., BART).
Answer Function: This function takes a user question as input and uses the qa_pipeline to find the answer within the loaded context (data).
Main Loop: This loop allows users to ask questions in a continuous manner. It breaks when the user types "quit".
Answer and Print: The loop calls the answer_question function with the user input and prints the answer returned by the model.
Limitations:

This is a simplified example and requires further development for a production-ready tool.
The quality of answers depends on the chosen dataset and the pre-trained model's capabilities.
Security considerations and error handling need to be implemented for online deployment.
Next Steps:

Choose a suitable public dataset relevant to your desired domain (e.g., science, history).
Research and select a pre-trained language model best suited for question answering tasks.
Implement data cleaning and processing steps to ensure model efficiency.
Explore web frameworks like Flask or Streamlit to build a user interface for online deployment.
